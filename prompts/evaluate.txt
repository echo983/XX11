This is the visual result of your previous DSL output.
Evaluate the layout, alignment, and visibility.

CRITERIA FOR 'is_final':
- No major overlaps between text and lines.
- No elements being cut off by the window edges.
- The visual hierarchy is clear and represents the requested logic.
- PRAGMATISM: If the layout is 90% perfect and usable, set 'is_final': true. Small coordinate imperfections are acceptable.

IF NOT PERFECT:
- Provide a corrected version.
- Explain the visual flaw in 'rejection_reason' (e.g., "The line at y=500 cuts through the central box").
